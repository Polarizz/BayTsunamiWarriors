                <h2>What is<br>Dragon Boat?</h2>
                <p>For those unfamiliar with the sport, dragon boating is a boat of 20 paddlers, a drummer, and a steers-person, paddling to cross a finish line faster than their competition. Dragon boat is a team sport that emphasizes elements of power, speed, synchronization and endurance. The wooden boats are long and narrow with painted scales and a decorative head and tail, made to resemble a dragon.
                <br><br>
                As the fastest growing international water sport, dragon boat welcomes people of all skill levels with teams ranging from novice to recreational to competitive.</p>

                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Recently founded in 2018, Bay Tsunami Warriors (BTW) is a high school dragon boat team based in the Bay Area. Throughout the year, we participate in four local and international races and host many social events! With these fun gatherings, BTW seeks to create an environment beyond just paddling. Some of our non-paddling events include ice skating, beach trips, and our annual holiday party!
                <br><br>
                As a team, our goals are to always motivate each other to be our best and to create a positive atmosphere for fun and memorable experiences. For some, practices are a place to exercise & destress; for others, they can be a fun excuse to see friends on the weekend. Either way, we all work our butts off to stay fit and race-ready!</p>

                <h2>Practicing</h2>
                <p>Practices are usually held every Saturday at Bair Island Aquatic Center from 9:30am to 12:30 pm. (1450 Maple St, Redwood City, CA 94063)* For carpool, meet 30 minutes before practice at the front of Mills High School.
                <br><br>
                What to Bring? Dragon boat is a water sport so expect to get wet! Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and wear clothes and shoes you don’t mind getting wet. We have spare PFDs (personal flotation devices) and paddles so no need to worry about gear.
                <br><br>    
                *Due to Covid-19 restrictions, we, unfortunately, cannot have our usual water practices. Instead, we are hosting virtual group workouts on zoom and occasionally we host game nights on our discord server! Please reach out to one of the coaches if you’re interested!</p>
